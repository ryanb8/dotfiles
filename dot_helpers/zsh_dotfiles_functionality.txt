        - tab : complete current command or path if unique (or up to GCD)
        - tab+tab : show zsh-complete menu
        - tab+tab+tab + more tabs as needed: move focus to tab menu and cycle through options (shift-tab to cycle other direction)
        - enter : (in menu selection focus) select option
    - fzf-tab completion:
        - tab: display fzf-tab completion menu
        - tab + tab(s) or shif-tab(s) - shuffle through tab options
        - enter - (in menu focus mode) select tabbed option and close menu
        - / - (in menu focus mode) select tabbed option and search again (keeping menu open)
    - Auto-Suggestions:
        - right - accept and complete full greyed auto-suggestion
        - option-right - accept and complete greyed auto-suggestion to next space or path break
    - History Search:
        - up or down (with empty command) - cycle through old commands
        - up or down (with partial command) - cycle through old commands that match the partial command
    - dirstack:
        - run `dirs -v` to see most recent 20 directories (`dirs` command has other options)
        - run `cd -<number>` to change to recent directory (works with tab completion, tab after `cd -`)

Mac Details + Aliases:
- The system allows mac's hidden files to be seen in finder
- To turn this off, run the `hidefiles` command
- To turn this back on, run the `showfiles` command

Prompt:
- The prompt is formated with <user>|<current directory>
- When in a git repository, the prompt leverages gitstatus for git details
- The gitstatus home page has more information on what is contained in the prompt: https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus

Colorization:
- LS file colorization is currently configured for Mac/Unix/BSD operating systems, it should work with reduced functionality on linux.

Syntax Highlighting:
- zsh syntax highlighting is enabled
- See: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
